 <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>You only need a handful of simple ingredients to make this easy, crispy, flavorful oven fried chicken.</p>

 <p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>2 Boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
     <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
     <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
     <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
     <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose seasoning</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper
     <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
     <li>1/4 cup fresh flat leaf parsley (optional)

 <p><h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
     <li>Cut chicken breasts in half, lengthwise, to create 4 even portions.</li>
     <li>Place chicken in a large bowl and marinate in the buttermilk for about 20 minutes.</li>
     <li>Mix together the flour, paprika, all-purpose spice, salt, and pepper in a medium-sized bowl. Set aside.</li>
     <li>Preheat oven to 400ºF.</li>
     <li>Place parchment paper on a 9×13-inch baking sheet. Melt butter and pour onto the parchment, coating the bottom of the pan/parchment.</li>
     <li>Lightly pat each chicken breast with a paper towel to remove excess milk before dipping. Dip each chicken breast, one at a time, in the flour mixture. Coat both sides liberally. Place in pan.</li>
     <li>Repeat with all four chicken breasts, making sure there is a small amount of room between each breast in the pan. This will allow them to crisp while baking.</li>
     <li>Bake at 400ºF for 35-40 minutes (or until the breading is golden brown and the juices run clear), flipping each breast after 20 minutes.</li>
     <li>Remove from oven and transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with parsley if desired. Enjoy!</li></p>
